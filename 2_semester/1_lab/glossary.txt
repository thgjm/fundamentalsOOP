Project Glossary:

1. Core Components:
  BaseModel: The fundamental class that all entity models inherit from, providing basic CRUD operations.
  Connection: Manages database connections and query execution.
  QueryBuilder: Constructs SQL queries programmatically.
  Metadata: Handles entity metadata and reflection information.
  Decorators: Provide annotations for defining entity properties and relationships.
  Drivers: Database-specific implementations for different database systems.

2. Key Concepts:
  Entity: A class that represents a database table.
  Repository: A class that handles database operations for a specific entity.
  Relationship: Connections between different entities (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
  Migration: Database schema version control.
  Query: A request for data manipulation or retrieval from the database.

3. Operations:
  CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
  Transaction: A sequence of operations that should be executed as a single unit.
  Connection Pooling: Managing and reusing database connections.
  Query Building: Constructing database queries programmatically.
  Result Mapping: Converting database results to TypeScript objects.

4. Technical Terms:
  ORM: Object-Relational Mapping.
  DI: Dependency Injection.
  DTO: Data Transfer Object.
  Repository Pattern: Design pattern for data access abstraction.
  Active Record Pattern: Pattern where model classes handle database operations.
