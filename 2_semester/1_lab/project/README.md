## Yet Another ORM Implementation (YAOI)

This project is a custom ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) built with TypeScript as part of my coursework project. The primary goal of this project is to develop a functional ORM, rather than to outperform existing alternatives. It focuses on implementing core ORM features like query building, model handling, and relationship mapping while providing support for complex queries.

## Features


## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: For static typing and code scalability.
- **PostgreSQL**: Works with PostgreSQL. In the future will be work with more SQL databases.
- **Node.js**: The environment to run the ORM.
- **pg**: Used to interact with the database.
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework.
- **TypeDoc**: For generating API documentation.
- **Pino**: Logger for tracking events and errors efficiently.

## Project Structure

This ORM project includes the following core components:

- **Query Builder**: Constructs SQL queries using a builder pattern.
- **Drivers**: Different drivers for interacting with the database.
- **Dialects**: Different dialects for different SQL databases.

## About This Project
This ORM was developed as part of my coursework project. The focus is on building a functional ORM with features commonly found in modern ORMs, such as query building, model mapping, and relationship management. While the project is not designed to outperform existing ORM solutions, it aims to provide a learning experience in implementing core ORM functionalities from scratch.
